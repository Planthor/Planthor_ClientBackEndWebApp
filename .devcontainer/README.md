# Introduction to Devcontainer for .NET Core and PostgreSQL


A devcontainer is a preconfigured development environment that can be used for coding and debugging. In this guide, we will look at how to set up a devcontainer for .NET Core and PostgreSQL using Visual Studio Code.


# Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Visual Studio Code
- Docker

# Setting up the Devcontainer

1. Open Visual Studio Code and click on the Extensions icon on the left side of the screen.
2. Search for the "Remote Development" extension and install it.
3. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) and select "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container".
4. Select the folder that contains your .NET Core project or create a new folder.
5. A devcontainer.json file will be created in the selected folder. This file contains the configuration settings for your devcontainer.
6. In the devcontainer.json file, specify the Docker image to be used for the devcontainer. For .NET Core, the image can be set to "mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0".
7. Add the following lines to the "services" section to run PostgreSQL in the devcontainer
8. Save the devcontainer.json file and close Visual Studio Code.
9. Reopen Visual Studio Code and select the folder that contains your project.
10. Visual Studio Code will now build the devcontainer using the specified Docker image. This may take a few minutes.
11. Once the devcontainer is built, you will be able to develop and debug your .NET Core code as if you were running it on your local machine. Additionally, you will be able to connect to the PostgreSQL database in the devcontainer.
12. Final please zip the folder planthor_db and copy to `.devcontainer/file` 

## Conclusion

With a devcontainer, you can easily set up a consistent development environment for your .NET Core and PostgreSQL projects. This makes it easier to share code and collaborate with other developers, as everyone can work in the same environment. Additionally, the devcontainer can be used to test your code in different environments, without having to worry about any dependencies or configurations on your local machine.x
